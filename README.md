# Snekk üêç

Hi. This is my pet project for messing with docker, containerization, and managing networked application services

# Running

```
docker-compose up
```

Should spin up the bot server and a copy of the battlesnakes rule engine. 

It'll automatically run an instance of the game and create a timestamped log of the run on your host machine.

# Compatibility
I'm actually running this with podman, but it should be docker compatible lol
